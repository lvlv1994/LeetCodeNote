# 1041. Robot Bounded In Circle

两种情况， 

1. if chopper return to the origin, he is obvious in an circle.
2. if chopper finishes with face not towards north, it will get back to the initial status in another one or three sequences.

    def isRobotBounded(self, instructions: str) -> bool:
        dirs = [(0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, 0)]
        x, y = 0, 0
        d = 0
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == "L":
                d = (d + 1) % 4
            elif instruction == "R":
                d = (d + 3) % 4
            //d track了当前专的方向的index，比如d == 1，就是向做转，那就是x - 1
            // 当“G“的时候前进
            else:
                x += dirs[d][0]
                y += dirs[d][1]
        return x == 0 and y == 0 or d > 0
