# 1383. Maximum Performance of a Team

\(This problem is very similar to the problem **857 Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers** [https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers/](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers/). Employ priority queue to get the O\(NlogN\) solution. You can just check it.\)  
Each engineer is characterized by his/her speed and efficiency.  
**Step1.** We sort engineers by their efficiency in decreasing order. **O\(NlogN\)**  
**Step2.** With the sorted array, for index i = 0, 1, ..., k-1, we push the speed into the min\_heap and calculate the performance with first \(i+1\) engineers. We only need to record the max performance.  
**Step3.** With the sorted array, for index i = k, k+1, ..., n-1, if the speed of the current engineer is greater than the top of the min\_heap, we pop and push with it. In this way, we can calculate the max performance with respect to the i-th largest efficiency since we have the engineers with the k largest speeds in the min\_heap. **O\(NlogK\)**

_注意他的要求，at most `k` engineers，所以按照eff从大到小排序，然后把speed放到heap里，如果后来的speed大于heap里的最小值，我们再算一次会不会有更优解_

class Solution:
    def maxPerformance(self, n: int, speed: List[int], efficiency: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        worker = []
        for i in range(len(speed)):
            worker.append([speed[i], efficiency[i]])
        
        worker.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
        import queue
        heap = queue.PriorityQueue()
        total = 0
        result = 0
        for i in range(k):
            total += worker[i][0]
            minE = worker[i][1]
            heap.put(worker[i][0])
            result = max(result, total * minE )
        for i in range(k, n):
            lastNode = heap.get()
            heap.put(lastNode)
            if worker[i][0] > lastNode:
                num = heap.get()
                total += (-num + worker[i][0])
                minE = worker[i][1]
                result = max(result, total * minE)
                heap.put(worker[i][0])
        return result %1000000007
