# 294. Flip Game II

Game Theory backtracking problem,  no like finding the kind of permutation,  we do implicit backtracking:

`sOpponent = s[:i-1] +'--' + s[i+1:]`

If we can't win, we will go to another situation.

The trick is to record all string when we can win,  and return true, if other player can't win, it means we can win, then record it. At the very begining recursive, it means when we flip last '++' the other player will loss the game.

`class Solution(object):`

    `def canWin(self, s):`

        `"""`

        `:type s: str`

        `:rtype: bool`

        `"""`

        `self.canWin = {}`

        `return self.dfs(s)`

    `def dfs(self,s):`

        `if s in self.canWin:`

            `return True`

        `for i in range(1,len(s)):`

            `if s[i] == '+' and s[i-1] == '+':`

                `sOpponent = s[:i-1] +'--' + s[i+1:]`

                `if not self.dfs(sOpponent):`

                    `self.canWin[s] = 1`

                    `return True`

        `return False`
