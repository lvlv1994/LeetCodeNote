# 320. Generalized Abbreviation

This is definitely O\(2^n\). It is easy to explain. Every char has two possibilities, either abbreviate it or omit it. So there are total 2^n possibilities.

So there are two pointer, one is for current position, one is for how many chars are in abbre, so there are two helpers, and we continue to add char in the string, if the pointer1 == len\(word\), this is one of the results, the trick here is we add char every time we add and abbrev, so there will be no continue digit.

`class Solution(object):`

    `def generateAbbreviations(self, word):`

        `"""`

        `:type word: str`

        `:rtype: List[str]`

        `"""`

        `self.result = []`

        `self.helper(word,0,'',0)`

        `return self.result`

    `def helper(self,word,pos,cur,count):`

        `if pos == len(word):`

            `self.result.append(cur+str(count) if count > 0 else cur)`

            `return`

        `else:`

            `self.helper(word,pos+1,cur,count+1)`

            `self.helper(word,pos+1,cur+(str(count) if count>0 else "")+word[pos],0)`
