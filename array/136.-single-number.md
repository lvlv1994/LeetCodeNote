# 136. Single Number

Here's the reason why it works. 1\) XOR is commutative, a ^ b = b ^ a. 2\) a number XOR by another number twice makes no change on original number, a ^ b ^ b = a Therefore, if a number appears twice in the array, it makes no change to result. And if a number is unique, since 0 ^ unique = unique, so result = unique

class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        sums = 0
        for num in nums:
            sums ^= num
        return sums
```
