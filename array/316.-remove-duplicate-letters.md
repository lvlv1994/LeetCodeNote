# 316. Remove Duplicate Letters

### **Explanation**:

Find the index of last occurrence for each character.  
Use a `stack` to keep the characters for result.  
Loop on each character in the input string `S`,  
if the current character is smaller than the last character in the stack,  
and the last character exists in the following stream,  
we can pop the last character to get a smaller result.

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicateLetters(self, s: str) -> str:
        dic = {}
        count = {}
        result = []
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            char = s[i]
            dic[char] = i
            
            if char in count:
                count[char] += 1
            else:
                count[char] = 1
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] in result:
                continue
            while len(result) > 0 and s[i] < result[-1] and dic[result[-1]] > i:
                result.pop()
            result.append(s[i])
        return "".join(result)
```
