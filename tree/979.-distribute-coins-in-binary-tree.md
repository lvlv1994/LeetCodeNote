# 979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree

For each node, we use an int array to record the information **\[\# of nodes in the subtree \(include itself\), \# of total coins in the subtree \(include itself\)\]**. Then we know that for a certain node, if there are **more coins than nodes** in the subtree, the node must "contribute" the redundant coins to its parent. Else, if there are **more nodes than coins** in the subtree, then the node must take some coins from the parent.

Both of these two operations will create moves in the tree. And we just need to add the **absolute value** of the \(\# nodes - \# coins\) to the final result because the move can be "contribute" or "take". The time complexity is O\(n\) because we are just traversing the tree.

    def distributeCoins(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:

    def helper(self, root):
        if root is None:
            return 0, 0
        left = self.helper(root.left)
        right = self.helper(root.right)
        self.move += abs(left[0] - left[1]) + abs(right[0] - right[1])
        return left[0] + right[0] + 1, left[1] + right[1] + root.val
