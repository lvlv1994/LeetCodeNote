# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

recursive, 这题的精髓在于 mid + left + right &gt;= 2 和return的mid or left or right， 因为如果当前节点即是p q中的一个又是lca的话 就可以返回啦

```text
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        self.result = None
        self.helper(root, p, q)
        return self.result
    
    def helper(self, root, p, q):
        if not root:
            return False
        left = self.helper(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.helper(root.right, p, q)
        mid = root == p or root == q
        
        if mid + left + right >= 2:
            self.result = root
        return mid or left or right
        
```

iterative也是一个十分有趣的解法

1. Start from the root node and traverse the tree.
2. Until we find `p` and `q` both, keep storing the parent pointers in a dictionary.
3. Once we have found both `p` and `q`, we get all the ancestors for `p` using the parent dictionary and add to a set called `ancestors`.
4. Similarly, we traverse through ancestors for node `q`. If the ancestor is present in the ancestors set for `p`, this means this is the first ancestor common between `p` and `q`\(while traversing upwards\) and hence this is the LCA node.

        :rtype: TreeNode

        # Stack for tree traversal
        stack = [root]

        # Dictionary for parent pointers
        parent = {root: None}

        # Iterate until we find both the nodes p and q
        while p not in parent or q not in parent:

            node = stack.pop()

            # While traversing the tree, keep saving the parent pointers.
            if node.left:
                parent[node.left] = node
                stack.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                parent[node.right] = node
                stack.append(node.right)

        # Ancestors set() for node p.
        ancestors = set()

        # Process all ancestors for node p using parent pointers.
        while p:
            ancestors.add(p)
            p = parent[p]

        # The first ancestor of q which appears in
        # p's ancestor set() is their lowest common ancestor.
        while q not in ancestors:
            q = parent[q]
        return q
